This project is an application that allows us to list the repos of the profiles we want with the help of api.github.
A dynamic list is presented to the user with multiple filtering options in the repo list.
I facilitated the development and maintenance phases by using MVVM in the application architecture.
I created a reactive structure using Alamofire in the network layer.
